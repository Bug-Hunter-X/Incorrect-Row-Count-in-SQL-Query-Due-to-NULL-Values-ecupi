The SQL query uses the `COUNT(*)` function incorrectly, leading to an inaccurate count.  The `COUNT(*)` function counts all rows in a group, even if they have `NULL` values in the specified columns.  If the intent is to only count rows where specific columns have non-NULL values, then `COUNT(column1)` should be used instead of `COUNT(*)` for each column.  The `SUM()` function also needs to handle potential `NULL` values appropriately.
