This repository contains a SQL query with a bug that causes inaccurate row counts.  The bug stems from the improper use of the `COUNT(*)` function, which counts all rows regardless of NULL values in specific columns.  The solution demonstrates the correct use of `COUNT(column)` to accurately count rows only when specific columns have non-NULL values and demonstrates using `COALESCE` or `ISNULL` for proper aggregation of potential NULL values.  This is a common mistake in SQL queries, especially when aggregating data that might contain NULLs.
